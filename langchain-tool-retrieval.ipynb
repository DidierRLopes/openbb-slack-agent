      "- Amazon's recent financial statements show a revenue of approximately $513.98 billion for the period ending December 31, 2022, but with significant operating expenses, including $73.21 billion in research and development.\n",
      "- Despite the substantial revenue, Amazon reported a net loss of approximately $2.72 billion and a negative EPS of $0.27. This could be a result of significant investments and expenses.\n",
      "- Amazon's balance sheet shows a cash and cash equivalent balance of $53.89 billion, and a total debt of $140.12 billion. This results in a net debt of $86.23 billion. \n",
      "- The current P/E ratio for Amazon is high at 75.43, suggesting that investors expect high earnings growth in the future from the company.\n",
      "- Amazon's debt-to-equity ratio is 0.96, indicating that the company has nearly the same level of debt as it does equity. This could represent a moderate to slightly higher risk level.\n",
      "- The company's return on equity is 12.32%, suggesting that it is generating a decent return on the equity invested in the business.\n",
      "- The exact return on assets cannot be calculated with the given data, but it will be indicative of how efficiently the company uses its assets to generate profits.\n",
      "- Amazon's operating margin is relatively low at 2.38%, which could be due to the high operating expenses.\n",
      "- Finally, the liquidity ratio of 0.94 indicates that Amazon may struggle to cover its short-term liabilities if they were all due immediately. However, given Amazon's large scale operations and cash flow strategies, this may not be an immediate concern for the company.\n"
