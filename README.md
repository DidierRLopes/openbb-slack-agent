# GohAnalyst - OpenBB AI Slack Agent

This repository leverages [OpenBB's agents repo](https://github.com/OpenBB-finance/openbb-agents) to build a Slack bot that has access to 100+ financial datasets. This was done as part of my OpenBB Creaton 2023.

The blogpost associated with this can be found here: TBD.

## Getting Started

### Get OpenBB PAT

Sign up for the [OpenBB Hub](https://my.openbb.co).

This will allow you to [set any API keys for different data vendors](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/api-keys), which will allow your agent to be able to tap into more diversified financial datasets. Once that is done you can retrieve your Personal Access Token (PAT) [here](https://my.openbb.co/app/platform/pat).

### Create Slack Bot

1. Go into [Slack API page](https://api.slack.com/).
2. Click on "Your Apps"
3. Click on "Create new App"
4. Select from Scratch



## Disclaimer

This project was done only for the context of the OpenBB Creaton 2023 to explore what one could build on top of the OpenBB agent and will **NOT** be maintained or even improved.
